# WeChat

WeChat is China's multipurpose super app that has grown from a basic messaging platform to one that includes gaming and mobile payments. WeChat Pay is China's second-largest mobile payment platform behind Alipay, the Ant Group-owned app created by Alibaba.

WeChat is actively monitored and censored as part of the Chinese government's extensive mass surveillance apparatus. Information from the app is readily available to authorities on request, and users have been visited by authorities and arrested for content posted on the platform.
